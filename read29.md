Graphs
A graph is a non-linear data structure that can be looked at as a collection of vertices (or nodes) potentially connected by line segments named edges.

Here is some common terminology used when working with Graphs:

Vertex - A vertex, also called a “node”, is a data object that can have zero or more adjacent vertices.
Edge - An edge is a connection between two nodes.
Neighbor - The neighbors of a node are its adjacent nodes, i.e., are connected via an edge.
Degree - The degree of a vertex is the number of edges connected to that vertex.
Directed vs Undirected
Undirected Graphs
An Undirected Graph is a graph where each edge is undirected or bi-directional. This means that the undirected graph does not move in any direction.

For example, in the graph below, Node C is connected to Node A, Node E and Node B. There are no “directions” given to point to specific vertices. The connection is bi-directional.

Undirected Graph

The undirected graph we are looking at has 6 vertices and 7 undirected edges.

Vertices/Nodes = {a,b,c,d,e,f}

Edges = {(a,c),(a,d),(b,c),(b,f),(c,e),(d,e),(e,f)}

Directed Graphs (Digraph)
A Directed Graph also called a Digraph is a graph where every edge is directed.

Unlike an undirected graph, a Digraph has direction. Each node is directed at another node with a specific requirement of what node should be referenced next.

Compare the visual below with the undirected graph above. Can you see the difference? The Digraph has arrows pointing to specific nodes.

DirectedGraph

The directed graph above has six vertices and eight directed edges

Vertices = {a,b,c,d,e,f}

Edges = {(a,c),(b,c),(b,f),(c,e),(d,a),(d,e)(e,c)(e,f)}

Complete vs Connected vs Disconnected
There are many different types of graphs. This depends on how connected the graphs are to other node/vertices.

The three different types are completed, connected, and disconnected.

Complete Graphs
A complete graph is when all nodes are connected to all other nodes.

CompleteGraph

Take a close look at each of the vertices in the graph above. Do you notice that each vertex is actually connected to every other node on the graph? That is what makes it a complete graph.

Connected
A connected graph is graph that has all of vertices/nodes have at least one edge.

ConnectedGraph

In the visual above, this looks a lot more than what you are used to seeing. If you look closely at the different vertices of the graph, you will see that each node is connected to at least one other node or vertices. A Tree is a form of a connected graph. We will talk more about that in a bit.

Disconnected
A disconnected graph is a graph where some vertices may not have edges.

DisconnectedGraph

In the above visual, the disconnected graph shows that some nodes may not always be connected to other nodes or vertices of the graph. It is complelty possible to have standalone nodes or edges (also known as islands) in a graph data structure.

Acyclic vs Cyclic
In addition to undirected and directed graphs, we also have acyclic and cyclic graphs.

Acyclic Graph
An acyclic graph is a directed graph without cycles.

A cycle is when a node can be traversed through and potentially end up back at itself.

Here is an example of 3 acyclic graphs:

ThreeAcyclicGraphs

A directed acyclic graph is also called a DAG. This can also be represented as what we know as a tree.

Cyclic Graphs
A Cyclic graph is a graph that has cycles.

A cycle is defined as a path of a positive length that starts and ends at the same vertex.

Here is an example of a two different cyclic graph:

Graph Representation
We represent graphs through:

Adjacency Matrix
Adjacency List
We will represent the following graph as both an Adjacency Matrix and an Adjacency List:

UndirectedGraph

Adjacency Matrix
An Adjacency matrix is represented through a 2-dimensional array. If there are n vertices, then we are looking at an n x n Boolean matrix

Each Row and column represents each vertex of the data structure. The elements of both the column and the row must add up to 1 if there is an edge that connects the two, or zero if there isn’t a connection.

This is what an adjacency matrix looks like:

AdjMatrix

A few things to note from the above:

Looking at the graph we are representing, you can see that Vertex A connects to both Vertex D and Vertex C. To show this, we place a 1 in the position of (a,c) and (a,d).
We follow this same pattern for the other vertex’s and where they are connected.
If there is not an edge/connection between the vertex’s, we represent this by placing a 0 in the appropriate point of the matrix.
a sparse graph is when there are very few connections. a dense graph is when there are many connections

Within an adjacency matrix, an undirected graph will always be symmetric. This is not the case for a directed graph.

Adjacency List
An adjacency list is the most common way to represent graphs. An adjacency list is a collection of linked lists or array that lists all of the other vertices that are connected.

Adjacency lists make it easy to view if one vertices connects to another.

This is what an Adjacency List looks like:

Adjacency List

Looking at the original graph that we are representing, we can see that Vertex A has an edge to both Vertex C and Vertex D. As a result, we will place both Vertex C and Vertex D in the adjacency list. Just from observation, we can see that we will only place the vertices that are connected in the list. If there is no connection between the vertices, they are not listed.

Thinking about how we will implement this in code? Well, let’s look at what the visual is telling us.

We can visually see that we are working with a collection of some sort. The visual is depicting a Linked List, but you could easily make it an array of arrays if you’d like.
Each index or node (depending on the data structure you choose to represent the adjacency list) will be a vertex within the graph.
Every time you add an edge, you will find the appropriate vertices in the data structure and add it to the appropriate location.
Weighted Graphs
A weighted graph is a graph with numbers assigned to its edges. These numbers are called weights. This is what a weighted graph looks like:

Weighted Graph

When representing a weighted graph in a matrix, you set the element in the 2D array to represent the actual weight between the two paths. If there is not a connection between the two vertices, you can put a 0, although it is known for some people to put the infinity sign instead.

Using the graph from above, here is an example of what a weight matrix would look like:

Weighted Matrix

Within adjacency lists, you must include both the weight and the name of the adjacent vertex.

Here is an example of what this may look like:

Weighted List

Do you notice the differences and similarities of a weighted adjacency list vs an unweighted? A great way to represent the {vertices, weight} connection is through some sort of key/value pair data structure.
