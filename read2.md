# Python Modules and Packages
## Modular programming
refers to the process of breaking a large,  programming task into smaller, more manageable and modules. Individual modules can then be cobbled together like building blocks to create a larger application.

### advantages to modularizing code in a large application:

- Simplicity
- Maintainability
- Reusability
- Scoping: Modules typically define a separate namespace, which helps avoid collisions between identifiers in different areas of a program.

three different ways to define a module in Python:

- A module can be written in Python itself.
- A module can be written in C and loaded dynamically at run-time, like the re (regular expression) module.
- A built-in module is intrinsically contained in the interpreter, like the itertools module.

### A moduleâ€™s  are accessed the same way in all three cases: with the import statement.
*import <module_name>
*from <module_name> import <name(s)>
### It is also possible to import individual objects but enter them into the local symbol table with alternate names:
*from <module_name> import <name> as <alt_name>
*import <module_name> as <alt_name>

  ### The dir() Function
The built-in function dir() returns a list of defined names in a namespace. Without arguments, it produces an alphabetically sorted list of names in the current local symbol table:

#### Modules are often designed with the capability to run as a standalone script for purposes of testing the functionality that is contained within the module. This is referred to as unit testing.

### Reloading a Module
For reasons of efficiency, a module is only loaded once per interpreter session. 
```
>>> import mod
a = [100, 200, 300]

>>> import mod

>>> import importlib
>>> importlib.reload(mod)

a = [100, 200, 300]
```
