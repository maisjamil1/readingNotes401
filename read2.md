# Python Modules and Packages
## Modular programming
refers to the process of breaking a large,  programming task into smaller, more manageable and modules. Individual modules can then be cobbled together like building blocks to create a larger application.

### advantages to modularizing code in a large application:

- Simplicity
- Maintainability
- Reusability
- Scoping: Modules typically define a separate namespace, which helps avoid collisions between identifiers in different areas of a program.

three different ways to define a module in Python:

- A module can be written in Python itself.
- A module can be written in C and loaded dynamically at run-time, like the re (regular expression) module.
- A built-in module is intrinsically contained in the interpreter, like the itertools module.

### A moduleâ€™s  are accessed the same way in all three cases: with the import statement.
