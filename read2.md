# Python Modules and Packages
## Modular programming
refers to the process of breaking a large,  programming task into smaller, more manageable and modules. Individual modules can then be cobbled together like building blocks to create a larger application.

### advantages to modularizing code in a large application:

- Simplicity
- Maintainability
- Reusability
- Scoping: Modules typically define a separate namespace, which helps avoid collisions between identifiers in different areas of a program.
