            {/* A <Switch> looks through its children <Route>s and
                renders the first one that matches the current URL. */}
            <Switch>
              <Route path="/about">

  function Topics() {

    return (
      <div>
        <h2>Topics</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <Link to={`${match.url}/components`}>Components</Link>

        </ul>

        {/* The Topics page has its own <Switch> with more routes
            that build on the /topics URL path. You can think of the
            2nd <Route> here as an "index" page for all topics, or
            the page that is shown when no topic is selected */}
        <Switch>
          <Route path={`${match.path}/:topicId`}>
            <Topic />
          </Route>

  }

  function Topic() {
    let { topicId } = useParams();
    return <h3>Requested topic ID: {topicId}</h3>;
  }

How do I add CSS classes to components?

Pass a string as the className prop:

    render() {
      return <span className="menu navigation-menu">Menu</span>
    }
    

  render() {
  let className = 'menu';
  if (this.props.isActive) {
    className += ' menu-active';
  }
  return <span className={className}>Menu</span>
  }
Can I use inline styles?

Yes, see the docs on styling here.
Are inline styles bad?

CSS classes are generally better for performance than inline styles.
What is CSS-in-JS?

“CSS-in-JS” refers to a pattern where CSS is composed using JavaScript instead of defined in external files.

Note that this functionality is not a part of React, but provided by third-party libraries. React does not have an opinion about how styles are defined; if in doubt, a good starting point is to define your styles in a separate *.css file as usual and refer to them using className.

Can I do animations in React?

React can be used to power animations. See React Transition Group and React Motion or React Spring, for example.
 (Links to an external site.)Create a Next.js App
To build a complete web application with React from scratch:
1 - Code has to be bundled using a bundler like webpack and transformed using a compiler like Babel.
2 - You need to do production optimizations such as code splitting.
3 - You might want to statically pre-render some pages for performance and SEO. You might also want to use server-side rendering or client-side rendering.
4 - You might have to write some server-side code to connect your React app to your data store.
Next.js has the best-in-class "Developer Experience" and many built-in features; a sample of them are:
1 - An intuitive page-based routing system (with support for dynamic routes)
2 - Pre-rendering, both static generation (SSG) and server-side rendering (SSR) are supported on a per-page basis
3 - Automatic code splitting for faster page loads
4 - Client-side routing with optimized prefetching
5 - Built-in CSS and Sass support, and support for any CSS-in-JS library
6 - Development environment with Fast Refresh support
7 - API routes to build API endpoints with Serverless Functions
8 - Fully extendable

If you wanted to watch (instead of manually build) your input.scss file, you'd just add the watch flag to your command, like so: sass --watch input.scss output.css

Mixins: Some things in CSS are a bit tedious to write, especially with CSS3 and the many vendor prefixes that exist. A mixin lets you make groups of CSS declarations that you want to reuse throughout your site. You can even pass in values to make your mixin more flexible. A good use of a mixin is for vendor prefixes. Here's an example for transform.

Extend/Inheritance: This is one of the most useful features of Sass. Using @extend lets you share a set of CSS properties from one selector to another.

Operators:Doing math in your CSS is very helpful. Sass has a handful of standard math operators like +, -, *, /, and %. In our example we're going to do some simple math to calculate widths for an aside & article.
