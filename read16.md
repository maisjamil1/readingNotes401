# Machine learning
## Machine learning is a comprehensive approach to solving problems.
### What makes machine learning so special?
Machine learning is the practice of teaching computers how to learn patterns from data, often for making decisions or predictions.
For true machine learning, the computer must be able to learn patterns that it's not explicitly programmed to identify.
### Machine Learning Tasks
Academic machine learning starts with and focuses on individual algorithms. However, in applied machine learning, you should first pick the right machine learning task for the job.

### The two most common categories of tasks are supervised learning and unsupervised learning. (There are other tasks as well, but the concepts you'll learn in this course will be widely applicable.)

* Supervised Learning
Supervised learning includes tasks for "labeled" data (i.e. you have a target variable).


* Unsupervised Learning
Unsupervised learning includes tasks for "unlabeled" data (i.e. you do not have a target variable).
