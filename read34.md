 ## The cybersecurity risk of self-driving cars
* Proponents of autonomous vehicles say that the technology has the potential to benefit society in a range of ways, from boosting economic productivity to reducing urban congestion. But others—have expressed serious concerns over the cybersecurity of the so- As one tech reporter put it: "Could cybercriminals remotely hijack an autonomous car's electronics with the intent to cause a crash? Could terrorists commandeer the vehicles as weapons? Could data stored onboard be unlocked?"



* it is very difficult to create software without any bugs—especially when the software is very complex. Bugs may sometimes be security vulnerabilities, and may be exploitable. Hence, very complex systems such as self-driving cars might contain vulnerabilities that may be potentially exploited by hackers, or may rely on sensors for making decisions that may be tricked by hackers. For example, a road sign that looks like a stop sign to a human might be constructed to look like a different sign to the car. In fact, more and more research papers have been appearing lately that are demonstrating such tricks against machine learning systems.


* As a result, car manufacturers, like other industries, are trying to come up with defense techniques that can prevent attacks against their systems.  clearly, the less security vulnerabilities you have in your software, the less vulnerable you become to hacker attacks. Hence, I would imagine that a lot of effort is being put into designing secure, reliable systems. I would also guess that just like in passenger airplanes, cars of the future would also have different computer networks so that one network that is potentially compromised will not affect the car's other sensitive computer networks.


* I am not sure the security problem can solely be solved by regulation. The government, in my opinion, needs to be involved, but it is incredibly difficult to test an existing complex system and certify that it is secure. Rather, I think the government could check if car manufacturers are adhering to some predefined secure coding practices while ensuring they have taken some basic security precautions.

## The ethical dilemmas of self-driving cars
No one believes accidents will be eliminated entirely, which brings up an ethical dilemma: Who should the car harm if it finds itself in one of those unavoidable situations? Do children, elderly people or other factors change the equation?


Germany last year became the first country to attempt to answer such morbid questions with actual guidelines. The proposed rules state that self-driving cars should always attempt to minimize human death and shouldn't discriminate between individuals based on age, gender or any other factor. Human lives should also always be given priority over animals or property.



This revelation suggests the issue isn't solely about ethics, but rather it's also about control. People think ethically in principle, but in practice they behave more selfishly, especially if they are not in command of a situation.



Self-driving cars will also introduce new forms of human control. Not having to own a vehicle and hiring one only when it's needed will itself be a major new form – one that will likely give many people more control over their monthly finances. Passengers are also likely to have more choice over vehicle settings, preferences and routes, not to mention what they do while they're in the car.
