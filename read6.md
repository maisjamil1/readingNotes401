## Risk Analysis
risk analysis is the process of identifying the risks in applications or software that you built and prioritizing them to test.After that, the process of assigning the level of risk is done. The categorization of the risks takes place, hence, the impact of the risk is calculated.

#### Possible risks that you could encounter
- Use of new hardware
- Use of new technology
- Use of new automation tool
- The sequence of code
- Availability of test resources for the application

### so why would we have risk analysis in software development ?
After knowing about the risk areas, it helps the developers and managers to mitigate the risks.

### How to perform Risk Analysis?
Searching the risk

Analyzing the impact of each individual risk

Measures for the risk identified
