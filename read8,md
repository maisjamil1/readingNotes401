# List Comprehensions
List comprehensions provide a concise way to create lists.
The list comprehension always returns a result list.

### Syntax
The list comprehension starts with a ‘[‘ and ‘]’, square brackets
```
[ expression for item in list if conditional ]

```
The basic syntax uses square brackets.

* new_list
The new list (result).

* expression(i)
Expression is based on the variable used for each element in the old list.

* for i in old_list
The word for followed by the variable name to use, followed by the word in the
old list.

* if filter(i)
Apply a filter with an If-statement.

### examples:

```
new_range = [i * i for i in range(5) if i % 2 == 0]
```

```
>>> [x.lower() for x in ["A","B","C"]]
['a', 'b', 'c']
```
